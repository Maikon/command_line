The mv command enables the user to move files between different locations but also for renaming a file.

i.e Moving/Renaming a file assuming you're in Mumbo directory: 

mv file.txt ../ # will move the file from the current directory to the one above.

mv file.txt afile.txt # will rename file.txt to afile.txt
